#Code Scanner System Design
What is a Code Scanner?(Purpose)
A code scanner is a web application where users can paste their code into a text box and receive output after scanning and analyzing the code. It can be used to check for syntax errors, coding standards, security vulnerabilities, or even provide code improvements and suggestions.

Requirements
Our system should meet the following requirements:  
##Functional Requirements
>Paste Code: Users should be able to paste their code into a text box.
>Scan Code: The system should scan the code for errors, improvements, and vulnerabilities.
>Display Results: The output should be displayed back to the user in a readable format.
>Multiple Languages: Support multiple programming languages.
>User Authentication: Users should be able to log in and save their scans for future reference.
>History: Users should be able to view the history of their scanned codes.

##Non-Functional Requirements
>High Availability: The system should be highly available with minimal downtime.
>Low Latency: The system should process the code and return results with minimal latency.
>Scalability: The system should be able to scale to handle many concurrent users.
>Security: The system should ensure user data and code are secure.

##Extended Requirements
>Metrics and Analytics: Track and display usage metrics and analytics.
>Code Improvement Suggestions: Provide suggestions to improve the code.
>Integration with IDEs: Allow integration with popular IDEs.
